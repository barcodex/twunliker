Automatic unliker of tweets

Twitter is a service to send status updates using no more 140 symbols.

This repository contains a script that makes it possible to automate unliking tweets on Twitter - in less than 140 lines of JavaScript.

You will need to install the dependencies first, though.

Either

```bash
npm install twitter
```

to install that single dependency, or

```bash
npm install
```

to make sure that dependencies are installed as instructed in `package.json`.

After that, provide data for your own Twitter App in the first lines of `index.js` and you're good to go:

```bash
node index.js
```

Happy growth hacking - but do not abuse the Twitter. They are good guys.
